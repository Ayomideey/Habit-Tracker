Habit Tracker: 
The Habit Tracker app is a simple mobile application built with Jetpack Compose that allows users to monitor and manage their daily habits. Users can add, update, and delete habits, each with details such as name, description, consistency level (e.g. "Poor", "Good", "Excellent"), and number of days practiced.
All data is stored persistently using a Room database, so habits remain saved even after the app is closed. The app also calculates and displays a habit score based on consistency and practice days.
The interface is clean and responsive, featuring:
•	A home screen showing all habits in card format
•	An edit screen with input fields and validation
•	A confirmation dialog when deleting a habit
•	A customized top app bar and consistent visual theme using Material3
